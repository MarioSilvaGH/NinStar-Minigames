### Usage

> **Note:** This script won't work with projects made using GameMaker: Studio 1.4 or older versions of GameMaker Studio 2.

- Always make a backup of your project before using it.
 
 Tested with IDE *v2.3.2.560*.

1. Make sure that **sandbox** is disabled on your IDE.
2. Copy and paste this [script](https://github.com/ninstar/yyProjects/blob/master/Resources/project-cleaner/Script.gml) in the creation code.
3. Run the compiler.
4. Select the ``.yyp`` file of the project you want to scan.
	+ If it is the same one you are using to run this script, I recommend that you run this script using another project.
6. Wait until the process is finished, a log file will be generated.

> Alternatively, you can use [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VjIiQ5M5M4trpzSdJrKLIoAaseND1mrO/view?usp=sharing) compiled application.
